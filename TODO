class for follower (charge, explosion...)

add trajectory object, weapon object?

add score, life for each player --> a widget object !!

show damage taken with white highlight

use pygame rect object for collisions

special sprites for going right left up down

bug l56 in entity   collided (projectiles having several collisions are removed with friends)


??HOW to describe level ?identities as dicts of name, sprites (if none render font), weapons, trajectory...

idea: one thread for positions, one thread for drawing
