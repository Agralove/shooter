add trajectory object, weapon object?

collision should return culprit


period of immunity for certain projectiles

blasts shouldn't pass through

identities as dicts of name, sprites (if none render font), weapons, trajectory...

entity and projectiles shouldn't import pygame... (like scene)

idea: one thread for positions, one thread for drawing
