projectile maps not created by ships
initialized one per proj type

exact and rounded positions for projectiles (for low speed)

output boolean array of pixels for surface for collisions

movement speed shouldn't depend on CPU, nb of projectiles...
idea: one thread for positions, one thread for drawing
