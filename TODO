??HOW to describe level ?identities as dicts of name, sprites (if none render font), weapons, trajectory...
debug levels (stress test, low-motion..)

add trajectory object, weapon object?
target not on same line

add score, life for each player --> a widget object !!
support four players

??use pygame rect object for collisions
collisions between entities

special sprites for going right left up down


test makewhite on 1px (H&v) image

idea: one thread for positions, one thread for drawing
