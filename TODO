weapon should be able to fire multiple projectiles depending on the fighter level

bonus should die offscreen

one pixel projectiles hit on upper corner and not center !
charge isn't aligned !

are we skipping sometime one frame ? derval inspection

use
class A:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self.__dict__.update(kwargs)

instantiator in scene to uniformize instanciation and split entity

user can set keys and buttons/axis (as windows has different keys :/
so make a menu
and new scenes with levels as parameters...
and describe waves of enemies in level (at time, or waiting for event)
wave : enemy type, nb of enemies, trajectories, init positions

weapon object
link player keys , projectile maps, and ships weapons...


??use pygame rect object for collisions

bug of keyboard layout (use event.unicode  ??

idea: one thread for positions, instanciations, one thread for drawing
TENTACLE BOSS !!
