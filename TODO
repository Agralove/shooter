skin class to load only once surface and hit_surface

class for follower (charge, explosion...)

add trajectory object, weapon object?
target not on same line

add score, life for each player --> a widget object !!
support four players

show damage taken with white highlight
set_color key for transparency

use pygame rect object for collisions
collisions between entities

special sprites for going right left up down

??HOW to describe level ?identities as dicts of name, sprites (if none render font), weapons, trajectory...
debug levels (stress test, low-motion..)

idea: one thread for positions, one thread for drawing
